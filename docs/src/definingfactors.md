## IncrementalInference.jl Defining Factors

A factor graph is a bipartite representation where variables (denoted by larger nodes) are interconnected by a set of factors (smaller nodes) that represent some algebraic interaction between the variables.  Factors must adhere to the limits of probabilistic models -- for example conditional likelihoods or priors.
